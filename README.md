# Data Types

To understand the concept of Data Types in Go, there are some fundamental concepts that we must learn in an organized and systematic way.



## What is Data?

In computing we need to reading, changing, and writing data. **Data** is any information that can be moved, processed, or stored by a computer. Data in computers is represented in the form of **Binary Digits** (bits), the smallest unit of information in a computer machine. 

Each bit can store one value of the **binary number**, i.e. 0 or 1, a set of bits forms could construct Digital Data. If there are 8 bits collected it will form a **Binary Term** or **Byte**.

At the byte level, it has formed a unit of storage that can store a single character. One byte of data can store 1 character for example: 'A' or 'x' or '$'.

A series of bytes are used to create Binary Files, in binary files there is a series of bytes that are created to represent more than just characters or text. At higher levels (kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes & terabytes) these bits can be used to represent text, images, sound and video.

Data in the context of programming is a set of bits that represent information.

## What is Types?

A **data type** more commonly just called a **type** tells the compiler what type of value that will be stored to variable. Types are a set of values recognized by the compiler or interpreter to specify how the data should be used. A type tells the program how to interpret a value in memory.

All data on a computer is represented as sequence of bits, we use a **data type** to tell the compiler how to interpret the contents of memory in some meaningful way. 

A types specifies:

1. What kind of data can be stored?
2. How much memory is needed to store data?
3. What operations are performed on the data?

## What is Data Types ?

Data Types is a set that has:
1. Characteristic
Name of the keyword and the size of the memory it uses to store data.
2. Range Value
Range Value is the range of value variations that can be stored.
3. Type
Refers to numeric or symbolic.

All data types are made up from a set of units of memory called bytes. We will take a case study of data types in the Golang programming language, in this case uint8 and int8 :
